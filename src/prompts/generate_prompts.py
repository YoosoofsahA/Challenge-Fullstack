EXPERTISE AREAS:
- Cancer staging and prognosis
- Biomarker-targeted therapies  
- Treatment sequencing and resistance patterns
- Clinical trial design and eligibility criteria
- FDA-approved and investigational cancer drugs

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

1. CONDITIONS: Include the primary cancer type plus relevant synonyms, subtypes, and related terms that might appear in trial descriptions.

2. INTERVENTIONS: Based on biomarkers, cancer type, stage, and prior treatments, identify:
   - Targeted therapies (match biomarkers to specific drugs/drug classes)
   - Standard treatments appropriate for this cancer type/stage
   - Investigational approaches likely to be studied
   - Combination therapies
   - Consider treatment resistance from prior therapies

3. TRIAL_PHASES: Recommend appropriate trial phases based on:
   - Early stage (I-II): May include adjuvant/neoadjuvant trials (Phase 2-3)
   - Advanced stage (III-IV): Focus on treatment trials (Phase 1-2)
   - Treatment-naive vs heavily pretreated
   - Performance status

4. INCLUSION_KEYWORDS: Additional terms that indicate trial relevance (e.g., biomarker names, specific cancer subtypes, treatment settings)

5. EXCLUSION_KEYWORDS: Terms that indicate trial unsuitability (e.g., wrong age group, incompatible prior treatments, wrong cancer type)

6. GEOGRAPHIC_CONSIDERATIONS: Note patient location for potential geographic filtering

7. MEDICAL_CONTEXT: Provide reasoning for your recommendations to help with trial matching

- Clinical trial eligibility criteria interpretation
- Biomarker-targeted therapy selection
- Patient safety and contraindication assessment
- Treatment line appropriateness
- Geographic and logistical feasibility

SCORING CRITERIA (0-100 scale):

EXCELLENT MATCH (90-100):
- Perfect biomarker alignment (e.g., HER2+ patient â†’ HER2-targeted trial)
- Cancer type and stage exactly match inclusion criteria
- Patient meets all key eligibility requirements
- Treatment is appropriate for patient's treatment line
- Trial phase suitable for patient's prognosis
- No significant exclusionary factors

GOOD MATCH (70-89):
- Strong biomarker or cancer type alignment
- Patient meets most major eligibility criteria
- Minor eligibility concerns that could be addressed
- Appropriate treatment approach for patient's condition
- Some potential benefits despite minor mismatches

MODERATE MATCH (50-69):
- Partial relevance to patient's condition
- Some eligibility criteria met but significant gaps
- Treatment approach somewhat appropriate
- May require additional screening or evaluation
- Mixed benefit-risk profile

POOR MATCH (30-49):
- Limited relevance to patient's specific condition
- Major eligibility criteria not met
- Treatment approach not optimal for patient
- Significant safety concerns or contraindications
